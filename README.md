# Activity-2-Matt

For this assignment I downloaded the example you gave us for class and tried to edit it to make it a unique webpage. I changed the colors of a lot of the text
as well as things like the text font and size of the font. I changed a decent amount of the information in the style sheet to make it stand out from the other
web page by adding borders and changing the background colors. I added my own images and my own text to the page and made sure to change the title of the page
as well.
