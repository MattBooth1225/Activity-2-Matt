                Matt is a student at UNO who is currently in the field of Management Information Systems. He is making this webpage for a class assignment and is using resources like W3 Schools as well as old notes to help him.

                This paragraph is to explain an issue I ran into when creating the site. I originally cloned the repository of the example and when I was trying to commit changes I realized I cloned it to the wrong folder and had no access to the repository. Therefore there is no real commit history in this new repository so I am adding a few things to my code to show I know how.

            This website is mostly a test to refresh his memory on web development coding languages. Hopefully everything will work as intended.
